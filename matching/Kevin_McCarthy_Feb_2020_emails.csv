"Spectrum News 1 Interview on McCarthy's Bill, the Clergy Act","Now, McCarthy is unveiling that option, after working with hundreds of faith leaders, like with Pastor Terry Creed. View this email in your browser ( ** Spectrum News 1 Interview on McCarthy's Bill, the Clergy Act ------------------------------------------------------------ February 24, 2020 Today, Spectrum News 1 shared a media package on Congressman Kevin McCarthy's bill, the Clergy Act. The Clergy Act would offer pastors and other clergy members - many of whom opted out of paying into Social Security in their youth - a two-year ""open season"" to effectively opt-in to Social Security. You can read the article and watch the interview here ( , or you can read below. Faith Leaders Regret Opting Out of Social Security Spectrum News 1 Emily Nguyen February 24, 2020 WASHINGTON, D.C. - Pastors across California are realizing a big mistake they made when they were younger, and now they are hoping it's not too late to fix it. Some priests, decades ago, utilized the government's special option to opt-out of social security based on religious principles. Now, many are finding themselves facing a benefit-less retirement. At this time, if a priest had opted out in the past, their only option would be to pay back all the taxes they owe from when they opted out, which could amount to tens of thousands of dollars and is not a popular option. For the last year, pastors have turned to the top California Republican, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, for a new option. Now, McCarthy is unveiling that option, after working with hundreds of faith leaders, like with Pastor Terry Creed. Creed and his wife have spent their whole life working in churches, and have gathered accounts from dozens of pastors who have regretted opting out of their social security. ""They opted out as young men,"" said Creed. ""Kind of energetic; thought that they were going to invest those funds and put them into retirement and now they're looking back and they've spent the finance on other things."" Like on a home or building a family, said Creed. Creed, himself, faced the decision of whether to opt-out of social security at a younger age. He decided to stay in and build up benefits for retirement for him and his wife. ""She's my world,"" said Creed. ""She's been with me through working as a staff member and now as a senior pastor. I would love to see if something were to happen to me, for her to receive my social security."" Creed said he knows social security is vital to retirement, to a senior's health and happiness, but said he has heard from dozens of pastors who opted out when they were teens or in their early twenties. Bakersfield Republican McCarthy who, through a growing number of stories, prompted a new proposal which would allow all faith leaders to opt back in during a two-year window, after the bill passes, without paying the taxes they missed. Instead, they would work at least 10 more years, or 40 quarters beyond the opt-in date, assuming no quarters earned, in order to use the benefits accumulated during that time. The benefits for that minister would be less than someone who participated in all of their working lives. ""I think social security is one of the fundamental points that we have to protect,"" said McCarthy. ""And I think to allow the individuals who are working to pay into it, is the right thing to do."" Creed said if this bill passes, it will impact thousands of lives and families. ""It would be good for me just to be able to take care of my family in a better way,"" said Creed. Right now, Congressman McCarthy has gained support from a California Democrat Mike Thompson, who sits on the Ways and Means Committee. This Clergy Bill will have to go through Thompson's committee to get to the House floor, so his office says they are optimistic that this bill will get there, with bipartisan support, and then move onward to the Senate. If faith leaders opt-in and don't work the full 10 years, McCarthy's office said they won't get the usual retirement benefits, but that they would gain the safety net of disability benefits, even if they don't work the entire 10 years. The office said some senior pastors are willing to opt-in just to show younger faith leaders, whether they are pastors or other leaders like rabbis, that they shouldn't risk not having benefits later in life to save money. A similar bill passed back in 1999, which means it has been over two decades since any faith leaders have had a chance to opt into social security. For more information, you can reach out to McCarthy's office or the Director of Financial Administration at the Lancaster Baptist Church, who coordinates with Creed and many other pastors Ben Hobbs. ### ============================================================ Office of Congressman Kevin McCarthy ** Matt Sparks (mailto: @ ) , ** Brittany Martinez (mailto: @ ) 661-327-3611 ** ( ) ** ( ** ( ** ( ** ( ** ( ** Sign up for email updates ( Copyright Â© 2020 Congressman Kevin McCarthy, All rights reserved.
